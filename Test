Gamers are oppressed. why?
With racism, it’s a race of people

Sexism, is a sex/ gender

Gamers, despite being one of, if not the most oppressed group: do not have a ism.

I propose a new word vidism (and the fact that auto correct is telling me it’s not a word is truly insulting) I truly hope that this word will be added to a dictionary so that people will know the struggle and discrimination we go through.

Gamers are blamed for nearly every violent action, much like people of colour are blamed for higher crime rates. We are not allowed to bring our games into places such as: library's, schools, churches(or any other religious site), In the computer lab of my old school there were signs that said we are not allowed to play games on the computers, truly this cannot be understated that this is nearly the same as exclusionary segregation like in churches in 1800s~

And despite us being gamers, we dont have a movement to get us more rights, and when people say “being black/ female isnt a choice and gaming is” is insulting. we dont chose to be gamers, we are champions of the rift, saviors of pandora and even dragonborn! we didnt chose the games, we are the games. There is no-one saying games need to be cheaper or even free, but feminism says that tampons and other feminine hygiene products should be, and tho feminine hygiene products are necessary for women, so are games for gamers.

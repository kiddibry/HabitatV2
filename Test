Noobmaster69 is the online alias of a human video game player who used to insult his adversaries while playing Fortnite.

Biography

Nothing is known about Noobmaster's life except for the following. In 2023, while playing online a Fortnite match against the Kronan warrior Korg of New Asgard, the user known as "Noobmaster69" started to insult Korg to tease him, leading Korg to ask Thor, his ruler, to defend him. Thor obliges, and takes Korg's headset, he loudly threatens Noobmaster69, telling him he is Thor and threatens to come to his house, tear his arms off, and shove them "up his butt" if he doesn't stop bullying Korg. This causes the relatively young gamer to start crying, and Thor mockingly tells them to go cry to their father. Thor does not fulfill his threat as Noobmaster69 seemingly disconnects and runs to their father for comfort.

Personality

Noobmaster69 was a "toxic" Fortnite player and during a round of Fortnite began to mock, insult and belittle Korg, this shows that Noobmaster is extremely petty and immature. When Thor threatens him he alludes that Noobmaster69 is a child, which would explain his behavior and username. "Noob" is a term for an unskilled and relatively new player in any game, and he calls himself NoobMaster, which is either an oxymoron as you can't be both a noob and a master or it's his way of saying that he is the master of all noobs, and if you lost to him you are a noob. Either way, he thinks it's a funny username and adds a "funny" number like 69 at the end, further showcasing his immaturity. He is gullible instantly believing Thor despite being given no evidence. It is very likely Noobmaster69 is a child in the age range of 9-13 due to his immaturity, gullibility and habitual toxicity.
